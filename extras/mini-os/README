 Minimal OS
 ----------

This shows some of the stuff that any guest OS will have to set up.

This includes:

 * installing a virtual exception table
 * handling virtual exceptions
 * handling asynchronous events
 * enabling/disabling async events
 * parsing start_info struct at start-of-day
 * registering virtual interrupt handlers (for timer interrupts)
 * a simple page and memory allocator
 * minimal libc support

Stuff it doesn't show:
 
 * modifying page tables
 * network code
 * block-device code


- to build it just type make.

- copy image.final somewhere where dom0 can access it

- in dom0
  # xi_create 16000 test
    <domid>
  # xi_build <domid> image.final 0
  # xi_start <domid>

this prints out a bunch of stuff and then every 1000 timer interrupts the
system time.
