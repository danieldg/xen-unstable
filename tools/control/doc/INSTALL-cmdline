To install command line interface:

cd xeno.bk/tools/control
make cmdline
cp xenctl xenctl-cmdline.jar <dom0>/usr/local/bin
cp xenctl.xml <dom0>/etc
mkdir <dom0>/var/lib/xen

First invocation of command line interface will give a warning about not being
able to load the disk state from /var/lib/xen/vdstate.xml. This is ok, it'll
be created the first time you change any state in the virtual disk manager.

If you already have /etc/domctl.xml you can rename it to xenctl.xml to keep
your existing defaults.
