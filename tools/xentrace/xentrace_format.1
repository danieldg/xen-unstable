.TH XENTRACE_FORMAT 1 "11 March 2004" "Xen domain 0 utils"
.SH NAME
xentrace_format \- pretty-print Xen trace data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xentrace_format
[
.I DEFS-FILE
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xentrace_format
parses trace data from standard input and reformats it according to
the rules in a file of definitions (\fIDEFS-FILE\fP), printing to
standard output.

The rules in \fIDEFS-FILE\fP should have the format shown below:

\fIevent_id\fP \fIwhitespace\fP \fIformat\fP

Each rule should start on a new line.

The format string may include the following format specifiers:
%(cpu)s, %(tsc), %(event)s, %(1)s, %(2)s, %(3)s, %(4)s, %(5)s

These correspond to the CPU number, event ID, timestamp counter and
the 5 data fields from the trace record.  There should be one such
rule for each type of event to be pretty-printed (events which do not
have formatting rules are ignored).
          
Depending on your system and the rate at which trace data is produced,
this script may not be able to keep up with the output of
\fBxentrace\fP if it is piped directly.  In these circumstances you
should have \fBxentrace\fP output to a file for processing off-line.
