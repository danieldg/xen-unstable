Recommended (cards tested and working at full efficiency):
 3com 3c905   (3c59x.c Linux driver)
 Broadcom tg3 (tg3.c Linux driver)
 Intel e1000  (e1000 Linux driver)
 Intel e100   (e100 Linux driver) [*]

Driver ported, but may not be tested, and won't work at full 
efficiency (extra copies are incurred within Xen):
 ne2k, pcnet32/lance, rtl8139, tulip, via-rhine, 

*: Note that certain revisions of e100 do not support
   scatter/gather DMA. These cards will incur an extra 
   copy within Xen for every transmitted packet.
